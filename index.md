## [organize](organize.md), [modify](modify.md),  and [publish](publish.md) engineering documents and templates




## Why?

Calculations and drawings are the detailed road maps for building engineering
projects. Their clarity and completeness affect cost, quality and timeliness.
**rivt** is a tool for improving both by applying open source software
principles to engineering design documents. Using these principles engineering
professions have an opportunity to produce reusable calculation libraries that
can evolve and improve over time.

Because many 21st century engineering technologies are evolving slowly, design
methods may see little or no change for decades. Productive engineering work
now lies, not so much in technological innovation, but in understanding and
combining various established technologies and design methodologies.

Engineering documents are the mechanism for working out successful technology
combinations. Enabling cut and paste editing of 

- explanatory text
- drawings
- formulas
- calculations
- plots
- tabulated data 

from existing documents will improve in the design document process. Engineers
could explore more options, converge on effective design solutions faster, and
explore unfamiliar technologies more efficiently. When large numbers
contribute, document quality and breadth will evolve rapidly.

Engineering calculation programs are widely available, but they all include
barriers to sharing and reuse (see table). In general they are incompatible
with each other, have high initial and continuing upgrade costs, with limited
reporting and version control features.

As a result, nearly identical engineering documents are repeatedly written
simply because resuable documents and templates are unavailable. **rivt** was
developed to promote profession-wide document evolution and reuse.
