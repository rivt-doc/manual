### Why [**rivt**](terms.md#rivt)?

Calculations and drawings are similar to detailed trip instructions that map
out a precise route to a destination. Their clarity and completeness dramatically
affect cost, quality and timeliness of built projects. **rivt** is a software
tool designed to improve engineering documents using open source software
principles and the collective wisdom of the engineering professions. It
provides an opportunity for engineering professions to develop shared and
reusable calculation libraries whose clarity and completeness can continuously
improve, by building on numerous contributions.

Many 21st century engineering technologies are fully developed and design
methods may see little or no change for decades. Productive engineering work
then lies, not so much in technological innovation, but in understanding and
combining and adapting various established design methodologies and
technologies to the needs of a particular project.

Engineering documents are the mechanism for working out these successful
combinations. If universal "cut and paste" editing of large libraries of
existing documents becomes possible, including:

- explanatory text
- images
- formulas
- calculations
- plots
- tabulated data 

engineers could explore more options, accelerate convergence to effective
design solutions, and explore unfamiliar technologies more efficiently. As
document contributions accumulate, quality and breadth would evolve rapidly.

Engineering calculation programs are widely available but they include barriers
to sharing and reuse (see table). In general they are incompatible with each
other, have high initial and continuing upgrade costs, and their reporting and
version control features are limited.

As a result, nearly identical engineering documents are repeatedly written
simply because resuable documents and templates were unavailable. **rivt** was
developed to promote profession-wide document development and reuse.
