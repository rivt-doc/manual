### Why [**rivt**](terms.md#rivt)?

**rivt** is open source software for writing, organizing, modifying, and
publishing engineering documents. It maximizes document reuse ... minimizes
new writing.

Engineering documents (e.g. calculations and drawings) are like road maps. Good
maps reduce the chance of getting lost or making wrong turns. **rivt** improves
document clarity and completeness - which improves cost, quality and
timeliness.

Because land changes slowly, road maps only need updates, not re-creation. Many
engineering technologies also change slowly. Assembling engineering documents
from existing ones saves time and reduces errors.

Engineering is about integrating established design methods. At the document
level this approach needs fluid "cut and paste" editing from existing
documents, including:

- text
- images
- formulas
- calculations
- plots
- data 

This **rivt** capability, when implemented across large document libraries,
allows engineers to explore more options, become familiar with technologies and
find better solutions. The open source software model permits and encourages
continuous small contributions to such libraries.

Engineering documents include confidential client and project information
dispersed among generic descriptions and calculations. **rivt** allows private
designation of specific inputs and outputs, and automatically generates
documents of different types for projects or public libraries.

Engineering document software is widely available but it presents barriers to
sharing and reuse (see table). It has high initial cost, continuous upgrade
costs, limited report formatting and version control, and is mutually
incompatible.

Consequentially, nearly identical engineering documents are repeatedly written
from scratch, simply because reusable documents and templates are unavailable.
**rivt** was developed to change this world.
