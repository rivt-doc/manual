### Why rivt?

Calculations and drawings are detailed road maps. Their clarity and
completeness affect cost, quality and timeliness of building engineered
projects. [rivt](terms.md#rivt) is a tool for improving both, by applying open
source software principles to design documents. Using open source principles
engineering professions have an opportunity to produce reusable calculation
libraries that can evolve and improve over time.

Because many 21st century engineering technologies are changing slowly, design
methods may see little or no change for decades. Productive engineering work
now lies, not so much in technological innovation, but in understanding and
combining various established design methodologies and technologies.

Engineering documents are the mechanism for working out successful
combinations. Cut and paste editing, from existing documents, of:

- explanatory text
- drawings
- formulas
- calculations
- plots
- tabulated data 

will improve the design document process. Engineers could explore more options,
converge on effective design solutions faster, and explore unfamiliar
technologies more efficiently. With many contributions document quality and
breadth will evolve rapidly.

Engineering calculation programs are widely available but they all include
barriers to sharing and reuse (see table). In general they are incompatible
with each other, have high initial and continuing upgrade costs, and limited
reporting and version control features.

As a result, nearly identical engineering documents are repeatedly written
simply because resuable documents and templates are unavailable. **rivt** was
developed to promote profession-wide document evolution and reuse.
