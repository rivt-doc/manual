### Why [**rivt**](terms.md#rivt)?

Calculations and drawings are detailed road maps. Their clarity and
completeness affect cost, quality and timeliness of built projects.
[rivt](terms.md#rivt) is a software tool designed to improve engineering
documents by applying open source software principles. These principles provide
engineering professions an opportunity to produce large, reusable calculation
libraries that improve clarity and completeness over time by building on many contributions.

Often 21st century engineering technologies are fully developed and design
methods may see little or no change for decades. Productive engineering work
then lies, not so much in technological innovation, but in understanding and
combining and adapting various established design methodologies and
technologies to the needs of a particular project.

Engineering documents are the mechanism for working out these successful
combinations. If universal "cut and paste" editing of large libraries of
existing documents becomes possible, including:

- explanatory text
- images
- formulas
- calculations
- plots
- tabulated data 

engineers could explore more options, accelerate convergence to effective
design solutions, and explore unfamiliar technologies more efficiently. As
document contributions accumulate, quality and breadth would evolve rapidly.

Engineering calculation programs are widely available but they include barriers
to sharing and reuse (see table). In general they are incompatible with each
other, have high initial and continuing upgrade costs, and their reporting and
version control features are limited.

As a result, nearly identical engineering documents are repeatedly written
simply because resuable documents and templates were unavailable. **rivt** was
developed to promote profession-wide document development and reuse.
