Overview
========

**rivt** is a markup language and framework for writing and publishing
engineering documents, with an emphasis on template reuse.

Software for engineering documents is already widely available but they come
with barriers to modifying, sharing and resuing source files. These include high
initial software and update costs, incompatibility between various programs and
upgrades, and limited operating system support. Therefore, similar engineering
documents need to be repeatedly written from scratch to accomodate different
software programs. The table below summarizes the features addressed by **rivt**
to address this wasted effort.
