### Why [**rivt**](terms.md#rivt)?

**rivt** is open source software for organizing, modifying and publishing
engineering documents. It was written, as most open source software, to scratch
and itch.

Calculations and drawings are similar to detailed trip instructions that map
out a precise route to a destination. Their clarity and completeness
dramatically affect cost, quality and timeliness of built projects. **rivt**
was written to improve the production of engineering documents by using open
source software principles and the collective wisdom of the engineering
professions. 

It provides an opportunity for the professions to develop shared and reusable
document libraries that will save time and improve clarity and completeness by
integrating many small improvements over time.

Many 21st century engineering technologies are fully developed. Design methods
may see little or no change for decades. Productive engineering work lies more
in combining and adapting various established design methodologies and
technologies to the needs of a particular project than in major new
technological innovation.

Engineering documents are the mechanism for working out these successful
combinations. Universal "cut and paste" editing of: 

- explanatory text
- images
- formulas
- calculations
- plots
- tabulated data 

across large existing libraries would bring some welcome change. Engineers will
explore more options, accelerate convergence to effective design solutions, and
become familiar with a broader set of technologies. As document contributions
accumulate, quality and breadth will evolve rapidly.

Engineering calculation programs are widely available but they include barriers
to sharing and reuse (see table). In general they are incompatible with each
other, have high initial and upgrade costs, and their reporting and version
control features are limited.

As a result, nearly identical engineering documents are repeatedly written
simply because resuable documents and templates were unavailable. **rivt** was
developed to promote profession-wide document development, improvement and
reuse.
