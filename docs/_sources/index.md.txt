### Why [**rivt**](terms.md#rivt)?

**rivt** is open source software for writing, organizing, modifying, and
publishing engineering documents. It minimizes writing - and maximizes reuse of
existing documents.

Engineering documents (e.g. calculations and drawings) are like maps to a
destination. Good maps reduce the chance of getting lost or making wrong turns.
**rivt** improves clarity and completeness which improves cost, quality and
timeliness of projects.

Because land changes slowly, new road maps only need to update existing maps.
Similarly, many engineering technologies change slowly. Updates save time and
reduce errors. Engineering work today depends on integrating established
methods into a new project or design. 

At the software level this requires easily connecting existing documents, or
parts of documents, in new ways. **rivt** adds universal "cut and paste"
editing of:

- text
- images
- formulas
- calculations
- plots
- data 

When this updating capability is implemented across large diverse libraries,
engineers will explore more options, become familiar with technologies and find
better solutions. As document contributions accumulate, quality and breadth
continuously improves.

Today, engineering document programs are widely available but present barriers
to sharing and reuse (see table). They are mutually incompatible, have high
initial and upgrade costs, and report formatting and version control features
are limited.

Consequentially, nearly identical engineering documents are repeatedly written
from scratch, simply because reusable documents and templates are unavailable.
**rivt** was developed to change this world.
