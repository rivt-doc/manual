### Why [**rivt**](terms.md#rivt)?

**rivt** is open source software for writing, organizing, modifying, and
publishing engineering documents. It maximizes document reuse ... minimizes
new writing.

Engineering documents (e.g. calculations and drawings) are like road maps. Good
maps reduce the chance of getting lost or making wrong turns. **rivt** improves
document clarity and completeness - which improves cost, quality and
timeliness.

Because land changes slowly road maps only need updates, not re-creation. Many
engineering technologies also change slowly. Assembling engineering documents
from existing ones saves time and reduces errors. Engineering is about
integration. Integrating known scientific ideas or technologies to solve a
problem or financial budgets to produce a result. 

At the document level integration means easy "cut and paste" editing to
integrate all of the ways engineers describe the world into new documents:

- text
- images
- formulas
- calculations
- plots
- data 

**rivt** has this capability to mix and match from existing documents and data
sources. When implemented across large document libraries it allows engineers
to explore more options, become familiar with technologies and find better
solutions. The open source software model it is built on permits and encourages
continuous contributions to such libraries.

In addition, engineering documents include confidential client and project
information interspersed among the generic descriptions and calculations.
**rivt** allows designation of specific inputs and outputs as private, and
automatically generates separate project or public documents for different
purposes.

Engineering document software is widely available but it presents barriers to
sharing and reuse (see table). It has high initial cost, continuous upgrade
costs, limited report formatting and version control, and mutual incompatibility.

Consequentially, nearly identical engineering documents are repeatedly written
from scratch, simply because reusable documents and templates are unavailable.
**rivt** was developed to change this world.
