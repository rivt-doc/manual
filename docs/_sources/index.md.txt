### Why [**rivt**](terms.md#rivt)?

**rivt** is open source software for publishing engineering documents that
minimize new writing and maximize reuse of existing material. 

Engineering documents (e.g. calculations and drawings) are like road maps. Good
maps reduce the chance of getting lost or making wrong turns. Because land
changes slowly road maps only need updates for new roads, not re-creation from
scratch. Updating is faster and less error prone. Many engineering technologies
are also changing slowly. Assembling from existing documents saves time and
reduces errors, compared to writing them from scratch.

**rivt** is designed for document sharing and reuse. It's easy to "cut and
paste" all of the methods engineers use to communicate their ideas:

- text
- images
- formulas
- calculations
- plots
- data 

**rivt** allows engineers to explore more options, become familiar with
technologies, and find better solutions. The open source software model it
builds on encourages continuous, additive, improvements.

Engineering documents sometimes include confidential information. **rivt** can
designate specified inputs and outputs as private, and automatically generate
separate documents for private or "shared template" purposes.

Engineering document software is widely available but presents barriers to
sharing and reuse (see table). It has high initial cost, continuous upgrade
costs, limited report formatting, limited version control, and mutual
incompatibility. Consequentially nearly identical engineering documents are
repeatedly written from scratch, simply because reusable documents and
templates are unavailable. **rivt** was developed to change this world.
