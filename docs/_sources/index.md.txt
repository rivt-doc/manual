### Why [**rivt**](terms.md#rivt)?

**rivt** is open source software for writing, organizing, modifying, and
publishing engineering documents. It maximizes document reuse and minimizes
new writing.

Engineering documents (e.g. calculations and drawings) are like road maps. Good
maps reduce the chance of getting lost or making wrong turns. Through document
reuse and public sharing, **rivt** improves clarity and completeness - which
improves cost, quality and timeliness.

Because land changes slowly road maps only need updates, not re-creation. Many
engineering technologies are also change slowly. Organizing new engineering
documents using parts of existing ones saves time and reduces errors. **rivt**
makes it easy to "cut and paste" all of the methods engineers use to communicate:

- text
- images
- formulas
- calculations
- plots
- data 

**rivt** has the capability to recombine parts from existing documents,
including data from a wide variety of external sources, into new documents. It
allows engineers to explore more options, become familiar with technologies and
find better solutions. The open source software model it is built on permits
and encourages continuous, incremental contributions to such libraries.

Engineering documents include confidential client and project information,
interspersed in generic descriptions and calculations. **rivt** allows
designation of certain inputs and outputs as private and automatically
generates separate documents for project or public "template" purposes.

Engineering document software is widely available but it presents barriers to
sharing and reuse (see table). It has high initial cost, continuous upgrade
costs, limited report formatting, limited version control, and mutual
incompatibility.

Consequentially nearly identical engineering documents are repeatedly written
from scratch, simply because reusable documents and templates are unavailable.
**rivt** was developed to change this world.
